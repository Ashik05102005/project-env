    <h2>- ðŸ§  AI Chatbot</h2>
    <p><I>An AI Chatbot is a conversational program designed to simulate human-like interactions using<br>
         natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning. Built with Python, it can understand <br>         
         user queries, respond intelligently, and even learn from past conversations to improve over<br>
         time . Whether it's answering FAQs, assisting with customer service, or providing mental<br>         
         health support, AI chatbots are transforming how we interact with technology. By integrating <br>
         libraries like spaCy, NLTK, or transformers, developers can create bots that comprehend <br>
         context, detect sentiment, and generate meaningful responses. With a Django backend, the<br>
         chatbot can be deployed on a web platform, allowing users to chat in real time, store <br>
         conversation history, and personalize interactionsâ€”making it a powerful tool for both businesses<br>
         and personal projects.<br>
